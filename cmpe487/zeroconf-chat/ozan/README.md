# CMPE487 python chat client
> Educational python chat client

Python implementation of the chat client that discussed in the class.  

## Getting started

No external library is used, therefore there is no need to run pip install. 
However, project doesn't support python2. Please use python3 instead.
 You can check your default python version by running these commands:

```shell
which python
which python3
```

Based on output of the above commands you might want to run either:
```shell
python chat_client.py
```
or
```shell
python3 chat_client.py

```
